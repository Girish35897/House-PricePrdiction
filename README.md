# House-Price Prdiction
First ML practice project
In this project I had taken Boston House dataset to make a ML model to predict prices
Steps involved:
    We will load the data set from sklearn library which is in Dictionary format
    Convert the file into a dataframe
    Perform EDA operations to clean the dataset and draw the valuable insights
    We will use visualization techniques in this process
    Then after cleaning the data, by removing outliers, removing the skewness we will perform the ML 
    To make ML model - we will split the data into train & test 
    We will make the Machine Learn 
    Then we will check the predicted values to the Original values for evaluation of the Model 
    Then model can predict the price for new inputs given.
